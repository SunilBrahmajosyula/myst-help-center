### Installing the License
For new installations of MyST Studio follow the instructions in the MyST Installation Guide:
https://docs.rubiconred.com/myst-studio/installation/myst-studio/#installation-using-the-wizard

### Updating/Renewing the License
Follow instructions from the `build-data-container.sh`. You can find more information about the script under the Advanced Scripts section:<br>https://docs.rubiconred.com/myst-studio/administration/upgrade/management/#advanced-scripts

If your license is due to expire and you are yet to receive the license please contact [MyST Support](mailto:myst.support@rubiconred.com "myst.support@rubiconred.com")

### What about the MyST.lic file I use to receive?
The `MyST-<name>-.lic.tar.gz` file is bundled with the license (`MyST.lic`) and the API key (`api.key`).

If your version of MyST only requires `MyST.lic` you can simply extract the license file from `MyST-<name>.lic.tar.gz`.
