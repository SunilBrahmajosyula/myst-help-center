### What about the MyST.lic file I use to receive?
The `MyST-<name>-.lic.tar.gz` file is bundled with the license (`MyST.lic`) and the API key (`api.key`).

**NOTE:** If your version of MyST only requires `MyST.lic` you can simply extract the license file from `MyST-<name>.lic.tar.gz`.

### License Expired or Expiring?
If your license is due to expire and you are yet to receive the license please contact [MyST Support](mailto:myst.support@rubiconred.com "myst.support@rubiconred.com")
